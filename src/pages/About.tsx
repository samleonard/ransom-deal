        Hi, this is a website. I don&apos;t really need a website for much, but,
        who knows, maybe I will some day. I gravitate more to backend
        programming than frontend, and I&apos;m certainly not a designer, so
        this serves as more of a starting point/example of some good development
        practices and infrastructure for a new code base. See the source code{' '}
        <Link href="https://github.com/samleonard/ransom-deal">here</Link>.

      <Typography level="h2" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Implementation Details

        I initialized this website with create-react-app to initialize the
        website. To the extent this website is &quot;designed&quot;, I used Joy
        UI as a design system. I used React Router for routing and Anime.js for
        animations.

        The source code is hosted on GitHub, and the service is hosted on AWS.
        Deployments are handled by a GitHub Actions; each push to main builds a
        new docker image, uploads it to ECR, then triggers an ECS deploy.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Linting and testing are also run by GitHub Actions on all PRs.

        The website itself is hosted on Fargate spot-instances behind an ELB,
        and the domain is hosted on Route 53.

            Migrate away from create-react-app, since it seems as though it will
            not be maintained going forward. The React suggest Next.js.
